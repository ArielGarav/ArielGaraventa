        Hello! I'm Ariel Garaventa, a recent graduate of Nucba's Full Stack Web
        Development academy. My journey in programming started with a passion
        for creating and problem-solving, which eventually led me to mastering
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and diving deep into the world of
        modern web technologies.

        My focus has been on building robust and user-friendly web applications.
        I have a strong foundation in React and Node.js, allowing me to develop
        dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces as well as server-side
        functionalities.

        For data storage, I often turn to MongoDB due to its flexibility, but
        I'm also familiar with MySQL for more structured data needs. My GitHub
        profile showcases a variety of projects that reflect my coding style and
        passion for creating impactful solutions.

        While JavaScript remains my go-to language, I'm also intrigued by UI/UX
        design and information architecture. When I'm not writing code, you can
        find me exploring the latest trends in design and user experience,
        always aiming to improve the visual and interactive aspects of my
        projects.

        Although my professional experience is in its early stages, I'm eager to
        contribute my skills and dedication in a full-time role. Outside of
        coding, I enjoy troubleshooting PCs and mobile devices, playing
        volleyball, and spending quality time with friends.
